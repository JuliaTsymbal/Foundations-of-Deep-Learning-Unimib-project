# Foundations-of-Deep-Learning-Unimib-project
Image classification task on the flowers dataset.

This project consists of 3 stages of modeling the flower image classifier. 
Several convolutional neural networks of different architectures were developed in the first stage. 
In the second stage, the transfer learning of the pre-trained RezNet50 model was performed. 
The third - fine-tuning of the VVG16 model. 
Two datasets were also used for classification: original and segmented. 
A comparison of the results is given.
